# YTMusicAPI

An Unnoficial API for Youtube Music

## TODO

- Figure out a way to Log in without needing to manually pass in the headers.
  - Current workaround is by using a puppeteer program to automate a browser. Slow but acceptable.
- Add More Functionality
  - Searching
  - Get Artist Data
  - youtube-dl integration
  - GUI


## Usage

Just Copy and Paste the damn thing ffs. 


## Note

This was just a pet project I made like an year ago in order to transfer my Spotify Playlists to Youtube Music. I would recommend using [youtubemusicapi](https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which has a lot more functionality than this one.
